# postgresql-sequelize
The backend of a store site was created using the nide js language and the express &amp; sequelize orm libraries, which is connected to the postgresql database.

I have come here to create all the necessary APIs for e-commerce sites, except for the payment process. Additionally, you are authorized to store and display images here

I used Postman to obtain the API so that you can also have access to it. I have placed the Postman file for you to import and use
